Decompilation of the AI related code in Kingdom Hearts 2, done using the OpenKH tooling

Contains two directories, and one script for adding informational comments to bdscripts

# add_txt_labels.py

Idemptotently makes the following changes and comments to all of the bdscripts

- ___ai - comment placed on lines indicating the ai txt command being referenced
- ___ref - comment placed on lines that were originally not decompiled into a reference, but as a known argument we know it is a reference to a specific line
- ___possible_ref - comment placed on lines that we think could be references based on the code-revealer line, but could also be values
- ___unk_ref - comment placed on lines that are known arguments which should be references, but those references are not found in the code-revealer line

# bdscript

Disassembled AI for every file in the game, with the exception of the following 47 "obj" that fail to decode using OpenKh.Tools.Bdxio

Contains some decompiled C for functions in the main ELF that seem related to the AI, in the hope that they can help with understanding the bdscript files.
